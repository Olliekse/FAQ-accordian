##### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

###### What I learned

- basic HTML structure of a web page, using <head>, <body>, <footer>
- using "absolute" positioning of page elements
- CSS to put elements into position using flexbox, with margins and/or padding
- creating a Javascript function to show and hide text
- making an adaptive page for laptop, tablet and phone screens

###### Continued development

- I'd like to make the Javascript transition smoother and more interesting
- Try to use "border-bottom" on a containing "div" instead of using a separate "div" for the separating border
